## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop on and build the knowledge-base book, you should:

- Clone this repository
- Go to the project folder `cd knowledge-base` 
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
- (Recommended) Remove the existing `docs/_build/` directory `rm -rf docs/_build`
- Run `jupyter-book build --all docs/` to build the book

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `docs/_build/html/`.

### Hosting the book

The html version of the book is hosted on the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. A GitHub actions workflow has been created that automatically builds and pushes the book to this branch on a push or pull request to main.

If you wish to disable this automation, you may remove the GitHub actions workflow and build the book manually by:

- Navigating to your local build; and running,
- `ghp-import -n -p -f knowledge-base/_build/html`

This will automatically push your build to the `gh-pages` branch. More information on this hosting process can be found [here](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/gh-pages.html#manually-host-your-book-with-github-pages).
